   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS ON CONTINUOUS", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=SURFACE 1
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 23 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** Calculated design heating load for zone=ROOM 2 is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.
   ** Warning ** Calculated design heating load for zone=ROOM 3 is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.

   ** Severe  ** Node NODE 8 connects to no component
   **   ~~~   ** Occurs in Supply Air Path=AIR LOOP HVAC 1 NODE 6 SUPPLY PATH
   **   ~~~   ** Check the connection to a ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections object
   **   ~~~   ** Check if this component is missing from the Supply Air Path
   ** Severe  ** An outlet node in AirLoopHVAC="AIR LOOP HVAC 1" is not connected to any zone
   **   ~~~   ** Could not match ZoneEquipGroup Inlet Node="NODE 6" to any Supply Air Path or controlled zone
   **  Fatal  ** Preceding errors cause termination
   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:
   ..... Reference severe error count=2
   ..... Last severe error=An outlet node in AirLoopHVAC="AIR LOOP HVAC 1" is not connected to any zone
   ************* Warning:  Node connection errors not checked - most system input has not been read (see previous warning).
   ************* Fatal error -- final processing.  Program exited before simulations began.  See previous error messages.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
