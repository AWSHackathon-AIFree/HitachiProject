   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS OFF DISCRETE", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS ON CONTINUOUS", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=SURFACE 1
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 3 zones are not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 19 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** Output:Meter: invalid Key Name="NATURALGAS:FACILITY" - not found.
   ** Warning ** Output:Meter: invalid Key Name="DISTRICTHEATING:FACILITY" - not found.
   ** Warning ** Output:Meter:MeterFileOnly: invalid Key Name="NATURALGAS:FACILITY" - not found.
   ** Warning ** Output:Meter:MeterFileOnly requested for "Electricity:Facility" (TimeStep), already on "Output:Meter". Will report to both eplusout.eso and eplusout.mtr

   ************* Beginning Simulation
   ** Warning ** Processing Monthly Tabular Reports: Variable names not valid for this simulation
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual variables.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-ELECTRICITY" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-DISTILLATE OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-RESIDUAL OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-NATURAL GAS" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-COAL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ************* Simulation Error Summary *************
   ** Warning ** The following Report Variables were requested but not generated -- check.rdd file
   **   ~~~   ** Either the IDF did not contain these elements, the variable name is misspelled,
   **   ~~~   ** or the requested variable is an advanced output which requires Output : Diagnostics, DisplayAdvancedReportVariables;
   ************* Key=*, VarName=ZONE AIR CO2 CONCENTRATION, Frequency=Hourly
   ************* There are 26 unused schedules in input.
   ************* There are 26 unused week schedules in input.
   ************* There are 100 unused day schedules in input.
   ************* Use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayUnusedSchedules; to see them.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
